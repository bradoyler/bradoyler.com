Created a new github repo the other day to build out a simple jQuery plug-in that accepts a calendarId from a public google calendar and builds out a nice looking timeline of pasts events. That’s right, jQuery is still really useful.

I found this timeline concept pretty useful for displaying & tracking a list of completed milestones for a project or even past career accomplishments.
