# 50-Year Mortgagea are a Leveraged Short on the US Dollar

Imagine locking in **today’s** interest rate and **today’s** house price… for the next **half-century**.

That’s what a 50-year mortgage lets you do.  
At first glance it sounds insane — who wants to be paying off a house at 85? But strip away the emotion, and you’re executing one of the most powerful (and under-appreciated) trades available to regular people: a **highly leveraged short on the US dollar**, disguised as homeownership.

## The Core Mechanic

With any long-term fixed-rate mortgage you borrow a massive pile of **today’s strong dollars** and repay them with **tomorrow’s weaker dollars**. Inflation does the work for you.

A 50-year mortgage simply extends that game an extra 20 years beyond the usual 30-year term — turning a good trade into an *extraordinary* one.

### Quick Example
- House price: $800,000  
- Down payment: 20% ($160,000)  
- Loan amount: $640,000 at 7% fixed  
- **50-year payment**: ~$3,800/month (principal + interest)

That $3,800 is **fixed in nominal dollars forever** (or at least for 50 years). It never rises with inflation, rents, or wages.

#### How that payment feels over time (assuming ~3–4% average inflation/wage growth):
| Year | Calendar Year | $3,800 feels like… | % of equivalent professional salary |
|------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0    | 2025          | Painful            | 60–70%                              |
| 15   | 2040          | Noticeable         | 35–40%                              |
| 30   | 2055          | Manageable         | 15–20%                              |
| 45   | 2070          | Pocket change      | <10%                                |

Your grandchildren will laugh at how cheap Grandpa’s housing payment is.

## This Is Textbook Shorting the Currency

When you short a stock:  
→ Borrow shares → sell them today → buy back cheaper tomorrow.

With a long fixed-rate mortgage:  
→ Borrow **dollars** when they’re expensive (high purchasing power)  
→ Repay with **dollars** when they’re cheap (low purchasing power)

The longer the duration, the more inflation you harvest.

### Why 50 years makes it *leveraged*:
1. **Leverage** — You control an $800k asset with only $160k of your own money (~5:1)
2. **Extended duration** — 20 extra years of dollar devaluation working for you
3. **Asymmetric payoff** — Downside capped (walk away or refi); upside from debasement is unlimited

## The Government’s Bias Guarantees the Trade

The US has a structural bias toward inflation:
- Deflation is political poison
- Inflation is the easy way out of a debt-to-GDP ratio that’s already >100% and climbing

Every extra year you push fixed nominal payments into the future is another year the Fed’s printing press erodes what you owe.

If we ever get 1970s-style 7–10% inflation again? The real value of that $640k loan gets annihilated — especially with the extra 20 years a 50-year term gives you.

## Historical Precedent
Countries with chronic currency debasement invent ultra-long mortgages for a reason:
- 100-year mortgages in Japan during its zero-rate era
- Generational mortgages in parts of Latin America

When people stop trusting the currency over decades, they scramble to swap cash for hard assets on the longest fixed terms possible.

## Caveats (Yes, They Exist)
- Property taxes and maintenance aren’t fixed
- You’re exposed to interest-rate risk if you move or refi early
- You need income growth to keep pace

But if you plan to stay put (or rent the place out) for decades and you believe the dollar will keep losing 2-4% purchasing power per year indefinitely (as the bond market currently expects), a 50-year fixed is one of the best inflation trades most citizens will ever be offered.

## Bottom Line

A 50-year fixed-rate mortgage turns your primary residence into a:
- **Leveraged**
- **Tax-advantaged**
- **Socially acceptable**

…short position on the thing the US government can (and does) print without limit — the US dollar.

The longer the term, the bigger your bet that tomorrow’s dollars will be worth less than today’s.

History says that’s usually a very, very good bet.
