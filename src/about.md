## About me
I’ve been working on back-end, middle-tier and front-end systems since 1999. I’ve tackled many tough problems around scaling an application, refactoring complex systems, and building a solution from the ground up. I’m a creative developer and don’t, however, consider myself a computer scientist. I build software for people (first) and typically out of necessity.

As for leading a project, I’m a long-time student of Agile and Lean methodologies. Although learning through carefully-crafted experiments, always comes first. I focus on determining which features to build and also which features NOT to build. Iterating quickly and validating the most valuable features first are paramount. Also, communication is the most underrated team skill, so I strive to improve that with every team that i work with, as it’s one of my specialties.

I’m a social geek and I’ve been heavily involved with the tech community by organizing events like StartupWeekend and curating for the StartupDigest. I even created a national event ‘PitchSwap’.

To sum up, I’m looking for talented, passionate people to work with on exciting challenges. Life is short, why not build something epic!
